# How to progress after Le Wagon :bus:

Hi there!

You've just finished some of the most intensive and hardest weeks of your life.
But you've made it! Congratulations, you are now full-stack developers able to
build great web projects from scratch.

But Le Wagon is just the beginning of a long journey. Being a developer is an
incredibly rewarding position because you get to learn new things every day. But
it is also a challenging role. With this repository, I want to share with you
some tips and resources to keep on improving your skills as efficiently as
possible.

## Solve your problems alone

One of the most difficult things after Le Wagon is that you won't have teachers
and TA anymore to help you every day. Of course, you have Le Wagon community on
Slack but it is not as instantaneous as a ticket. After Le Wagon, you should aim
at being really autonomous to solve your code problems as fast as possible. To
do this, you need 3 skills:

### Learn to read your error messages

During the bootcamp, you may have seen teachers solving problems you had been
struggling on for dozens of minutes just by reading your error message. It takes
some practice but learning how to find your error messages and how to read them
will solve 90% of your problems. Sometimes it will give you directly an answer,
most of the time it will narrow the scope of the problem. Good developers are
(almost) always happy when they see an error message because they know it will
help them solve their bug.

### Become a binding.pry god

When the error message does not directly give you an answer, learn how to debug
with `binding.pry` (or `debugger` for Javascript). Every time I see a bug I
don't quite understand, the first thing I do is put a `binding.pry` in my code
to see what is going on and how do my variables look like at this specific
moment. With good `binding.pry` skills, you will rock in the developer world.

P.S: Aaron Patterson, one of the most famous Ruby developer, is a "puts
debugger". It is another way to deal with errors. Enjoy
[this article] to learn more.

### Learn to Google a problem

When you are facing a problem you really don't know, get used to Google it.
99.9% of the times, you will find somebody who had a pretty similar problem on
StackOverflow. Google skills are the most important ones for a developer.

Other places you can find some help are: [Reddit]
and also directly on Github, in the [issues] section. There, you can ask your
question to people working with the same tool as you. Sometimes you also get a
reply directly from the creator of the project.

I'm talking about these two because they are not as much referenced as
StackOverflow but are sometimes more qualitative/recent !

## How to progress after Le Wagon

Here are my personal advice on how to progress after Le Wagon. I myself did/read
half of the resources and heard really good reviews from Le Wagon alumni about
the other ones. You can find free PDF of most of the following books on the web
but, if you can, please support the authors. ;)

### Get your basics right

After Le Wagon, a lot of things look like magic because you don't have time to
learn the core concepts. I found it super valuable to get back to the roots and
learn more about topics not directly related to a language to get this right! If
I was doing Le Wagon today, I would read the resources below directly after it.

1. Learn the most valuable Computer Science concepts in 1 afternoon with
   [Computer Science Distilled]. Best book ever!
1. Improve your Git level by reading
   [Ry's Git Tutorial], it is free and amazing!

### Improve your Ruby skills

If you know Ruby well, Rails will be so much easier!

1. Read [Eloquent Ruby]
1. Read [99 bottles of OOP]

#### To go further

1. Subscribe to [Ruby Tapas]

### Master Rails

Because of course!

1. Read the [Rails guides]
1. Read [The Rails 5 Way]
1. Read [Rails Anti-Patterns]

#### To go further

1. Subscribe to [Go Rails]
1. Subscribe to [Drifting Ruby]

### Get fluent in Javascript

Javascript is primordial but you don't know it well after Le Wagon. Take some
time to improve your skills.

1. Feel the need to practice ? Do the free [JavasScript30] course by [Wes Bos].
1. Want to learn the latest JS synthax ? Check [ES6 for everyone]

#### To go further

1. Read the [You don't know JS] books (available for free on Github).
1. [JavaScript: The Good Parts] is still a must read.

## After all of this is done

Web development is full of hype. However, I would not recommend you to learn the
latest Javascript library (I know you want to ;) ) just after Le Wagon. Take the
time to master your existing skills before diving into something more advanced
alone. Below are some options for when you feel comfortable (no real reading
list, I am an expert in none of these technologies).

### Go back to the roots to became a real software engineer

1. It is not too late to learn Computer Science. It will be a lot of work but you can follow the [Teach Yourself CS] program
1. Do the [Recurse Center], it seems to be life changing.

### Learn Data Science, the skill of the future

1. Andrew NG [Machine Learning] and [Deep Learning Specialization] courses are best in class
1. If you learn best "top down", give [Fast.ai] a try
1. Tired of Moocs? Enroll in [Dataquest]

### Try something different in back-end

1. Learn a functional language. [Elixir] and [Phoenix] (the most popular
   framework for Elixir) are great choices for Rubyist as Elixir was written by
   a former Rails core contributor.
1. I heard every good developer should be familiar with at least one compiled
   language. [Go] is still safe pick but [Crystal] could be an interesting
   choice for Rubyist.

### Focus on front-end... and go into mobile

1. Improve your CSS skills: structure it properly your vanilla CSS with [BEM].
1. Learn a trendy JS library (React or Vue.js for example) in [egghead]. Get a
   paid subscription, it is worthy.
1. Then, if you're conviced and want to create native mobile apps for Android &
   iPhone, learn React Native (there are good courses in [egghead] too)

### Learn DevOps

1. Enjoy a funny dive into DevOps with [The Phoenix Project].

## Other important resources

You should know about some resources. They will help you a ton in your code
every day. Here is a list of the main ones I can think of.

1. [CSS] and [HTML] references (+ [BEM] to learn to structure your CSS)
1. [Awesome Ruby]
1. [Ruby] and [Rails] style guides
1. [Ruby Weekly] newsletter
1. [Exercism] to test your skills with great coding challenges
1. A new way to [setup your front in Rails], by a former Le Wagon student
1. Do you want more? Check this [resource] by a former student with a ton of
   miscellaneous cools links ! :star2:
