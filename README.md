# How to progress after Le Wagon :bus:

Hi there!

You've just finished some of the most intensive and hardest weeks of your life.
But you've made it! Congratulations, you are now full-stack developers able to
build great web projects from scratch.

But Le Wagon is just the beginning of a long journey. Being a developer is an
incredibly rewarding position because you get to learn new things every day. But
it is also a challenging role. With this repository, I want to share with you
some tips and resources to keep on improving your skills as efficiently as
possible.

## Solve your problems alone

One of the most difficult things after Le Wagon is that you won't have teachers
and TA anymore to help you every day. Of course, you have Le Wagon community on
Slack but it is not as instantaneous as a ticket. After Le Wagon, you should aim
at being really autonomous to solve your code problems as fast as possible. To
do this, you need 3 skills:

### Learn to read your error messages

During the bootcamp, you may have seen teachers solving problems you had been
struggling on for dozens of minutes just by reading your error message. It takes
some practice but learning how to find your error messages and how to read them
will solve 90% of your problems. Sometimes it will give you directly an answer,
most of the time it will narrow the scope of the problem. Good developers are
(almost) always happy when they see an error message because they know it will
help them solve their bug.


### Become a debugging god

When the error message does not directly give you an answer, learn how to debug using breakpoints. Every time I see a bug I
don't quite understand, the first thing I do is put a breakpoint in my code
to see what is going on and how do my variables look like at this specific
moment. With good debugging skills, you will rock in the developer world.

For more info, see [the debugging Rails doc].

P.S: Aaron Patterson, one of the most famous Ruby developer, is a "puts
debugger". It is another way to deal with errors. Enjoy
[this article] to learn more.

### Learn to find solutions to your problem online

When you are facing a problem you really don't know, get used to finding the solution online.

- Google and/or [StackOverflow] : By googling your problem, you will find 99.9% of the times somebody who had a pretty similar problem on StackOverflow. Learn to be precise in your google searches to get the best result and always challenge the solutions you find.
- Large Language Models (LLM) : New addition in 2024, Large Language Models are getting really good at helping you debug (and build) your apps. I use GPT-4 and Copilot every day and it saves me countless of time. Just remember that the code they produce still need to be checked and adapted most of the time :wink:
- The source code : As you get more experienced, you will more and more encounter challenges that are less documented. Build the habit of looking at the source code of the packages you use when needed. Use `bundle open gem_x` in your terminal to see the code of a Ruby gem. It is often of great value and can even encourage you to contribute to open source.

## How to progress after Le Wagon

Here are my personal advice on how to progress after Le Wagon. I myself read most of the resources and heard really good reviews from Le Wagon alumni about
the other ones. You can find free PDF of most of the following books on the web
but, if you can, please support the authors :money_with_wings:

### Get your basics right

After Le Wagon, a lot of things look like magic because you don't have time to
learn the core concepts. I found it super valuable to get back to the roots and
learn more about topics not directly related to a language to get this right! If
I was doing Le Wagon today, I would read the resources below directly after it.

1. Learn the most valuable Computer Science concepts in 1 afternoon with
   [Computer Science Distilled]. Best book ever!
1. Improve your Git level by reading
   [Ry's Git Tutorial], it is free and amazing!

### Improve your Ruby skills

If you know Ruby well, Rails will be so much easier!

1. Read [Eloquent Ruby] (oldie but goodie)
1. Read [99 bottles of OOP] (or anything written by Sandi Metz)

### Master Rails

Because of course!

1. Read the [Rails guides], to get the basics right
1. Subscribe to [Go Rails], to stay up to date
1. Read [Layered Design and the Extended Rails Way], to nail more advanced patterns

#### To go further

1. Read [The Rails 7 Way]
1. Subscribe to [Drifting Ruby]

### Get fluent in Javascript

Javascript is primordial but you don't know it well after Le Wagon. Take some
time to improve your skills.

1. Feel the need to practice ? Do the free [JavasScript30] course.
1. Improve your JS in Rails skills by learning Hotwire with [Hotrails]

#### To go further

1. Read the [You don't know JS] books (available for free on Github).

## After all of this is done

Web development is full of hype. However, I would not recommend you to learn the
latest Javascript library (I know you want to :wink: ) just after Le Wagon. Take the
time to master your existing skillset before diving into something more advanced
alone. Below are some options for when you feel comfortable. Disclaimer: I am an expert in none of these technologies.

### Go back to the roots to became a real software engineer

1. It is not too late to learn Computer Science. It will be a lot of work but you can follow the [Teach Yourself CS] program and get your self-taught degree.
1. Do the [Recurse Center], it seems to be life changing.

### Learn Data Science, the skill of the future

1. If you learn best "top down", give [Fast.ai] a try
1. Andrew NG [Machine Learning] course is still a great ressource
1. Tired of Moocs? Enroll in [Dataquest]

### Try something different in back-end

Curious about the different ways you can write code ? Declarative, functional, imperative, there is something for every way of thinking. So why not learn a new language ?

[Exercism] is a great platform to give a new language a try !

### Focus on front-end... and go into mobile

I am really not a front-end expert ! Please forgive my mistakes and my lack of ressources :wink:

1. Improve your design skills, and learn [Tailwind], it is amazing.
1. Learn a trendy JS library (React or Vue.js for example)
1. Switch to mobile and learn to create native apps for Android & iPhone

### Understand your users better and improve your product skills

Product Management is a really natural path for new (or old) Le Wagon student.

1. As a Basecamp fan, I really like the [Shape Up] methodology.
1. I heard [Transformed], the last book by Marty Cagan, is even better than Inspired

### Dive deeper and discover DevOps

1. Enjoy a funny dive into DevOps with [The Phoenix Project].

## Other important resources

You should know about some resources. They will help you a ton in your code
every day. Here is a list of the main ones I can think of.

1. [CSS] and [HTML] references (+ [BEM] to learn to structure your CSS)
1. [Awesome Ruby]
1. [Ruby] and [Rails] style guides (or use [standard])
1. [Ruby Weekly] newsletter
